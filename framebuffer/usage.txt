fb -- tool to display JPG images on the framebuffer
Usage: fb [switches] <file1> <file2> ...

Description:

  "fb" started as a simple tool to display JPG or PNG files
  on the Linux console framebuffer. This allows displaying of 
  graphics in a non-X Windows environment.

  It has continued to evolve to be a tool to display
  graphic images, and drawing structures, along with simple
  scripting mechanisms, allowing a broad variety of drawing
  mechanics, and designed for eye-candy style displays.

  For example, one can display a sequence of images according
  to a pattern or a mathematical formula, either by a simple
  generator script, or via support within the scripting language.

  Whilst fb can write to the frame buffer, it can also write
  to a virtual frame buffer (allowing compositing style experiments,
  but also to allow easy capture or running, even inside an X
  window environment)

  There are many command line options, designed to handle specific
  rendering scenarios, but more of these switches are being
  migrated to the scripting language.

Montage mode:

  Montage mode is designed to allow display of a number of images, 
  in a random manner - designed to fill the screen, but each image
  is a tiny thumbnail - randomly placed. (Typically, random 
  placement is done top-to-bottom/left-to-right).

Switches:

   -clear             Clear screen
   -cvt <fname>       Write loaded image to file.
   -delay NN          Scroll delay in milliseconds
   -effects           Scroll-in effects enabled
   -f <file>          Get filenames from specified file.
   -framebuffer <fname>
                      Use virtual framebuffer
   -framebuffer_size <width>x<height>
                      Specify size of the virtual frame buffer
   -fullscreen        Stretch image to fill screen
   -info              Print screen size info
   -o <fname>         Write screen buffer to an output jpg file
   -montage           Display images as thumbnails
   -num NN            Only process first NN images
   -page N            Display page/screen N of the image
   -rand              Randomize files
   -script <file>     Script file to do complex layouts
   -scroll            Scroll image
   -scroll_y_incr NN  When using -scroll, scroll by this much.
   -seq               When doing montage, display l->r
   -stretch           Stretch but dont change aspect ratio
   -text <msg>        Display a text string in the frame buffer.
   -xfrac N.NN        Shrink image on the x-axis
   -yfrac N.NN        Shrink image on the y-axis
   -x NN              Set co-ordinate
   -y NN              Set co-ordinate
   -w NN              Set co-ordinate
   -v                 Verbose; list lines in script files
   -wait              Instead of sleeping before each image, wait
                      for terminal input.

Environment variables:

  FBVIEW_FRAMEBUFFER=<filename> If set, then same as -framebuffer switch.

Examples:

  $ fb -montage -delay 1 -rand -f index.log -num 30
  $ fb -script $HOME/src/rss/data/draw13.txt -f $HOME/images/news/index.log -rand
